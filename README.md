# Climate-change-rising-waters

Sea levels have been rising globally. Natural disasters cause the waters to rise at smaller scale 
and for shorter amounts of time. Urban planners for future cities and development as well as 
governments and citizens of existing cities need to know which areas are at risk of being flooded
when the water level increases. Write a program that uses your new expertise in recursion, stacks 
and queues to evaluate what happens to a given terrain when the waters are rising.
